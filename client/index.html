    <h1>UDP-like WebRTC Demo</h1>

    <p>You leave this page running long enough, and you should see pings go missing and stay missing.</p>

    <p>Your connection protocol is <strong>{{protocol}}</strong>. If you're on TCP, this demo presumedly will not work and you'll just have TCP-like semantics instead.</p>

    <p>Sent pings: {{pingCount}}</p>

    <p>Received pongs: {{pongCount}}</p>

    <p v-if="pingsReceived !== null">
      Server received pings: {{pingsReceived}} ({{pingsReceived / pingCount}})
