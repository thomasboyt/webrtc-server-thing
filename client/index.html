    <h1>UDP-like WebRTC Demo</h1>

    <p>Your connection protocol is <strong>{{protocol}}</strong>. If you're on TCP, this demo presumedly will not work and you'll just have TCP-like semantics instead.</p>

    <p>The graph below represents each sent packet. A packet that got a "pong" response will appear in green. A packet that did not will show in red.</p>

    <p>Once {{maxPackets}} packets have been sent, the server will be queried to see how many packets it actually received. This number may differ from the number of pongs received, since either part of the connection could fail.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Sent pings: {{pingCount}}</li>
      <li>Received pongs: {{pongCount}}</li>
      <li>Out of order pongs: {{outOfOrderCount}}</li>
    </ul>

    <p v-if="pingsReceived !== null">
      Server received pings: {{pingsReceived}} ({{pingsReceived / pingCount}})
    </p>
